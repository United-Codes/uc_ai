## Practical AI in PL/SQL Made Easy

This is the sample app I showed in our [UC Live webinar](https://youtube.com/live/k4Vt7AKXCnM). It features simple text generation, structured output, reasoning, file analysis, and tool usage.

### Setup Instructions

- You need to have UC AI already installed in your database schema
- [Download the APEX app](https://github.com/United-Codes/uc_ai/releases/download/v25.5.1/f135.sql)
- Then import the APEX app and install supporting objects
- For OCI and Ollama modify the `reset_global_variables` procedure in `pame_pkg` to set your credentials
