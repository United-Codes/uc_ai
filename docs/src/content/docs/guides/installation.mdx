## Prerequisites

- Oracle Database 12.2 or later
- Oracle APEX (older versions are fine, this project uses some of the APIs)

## Logger

The project uses the [Logger](https://github.com/OraOpenSource/Logger) package to log trace information like the requests and responses from the AI providers.

I do recommend installing the Logger package aswell as it helps debugging issues and keeping track of how the AI gets used.

However you have the option to install a "no op" (no operation) version of the Logger package which installs the necessary objects so that the packages compile but does not log anything.

If you want to use your own logging solution you can modify the no op version to insert the log messages into your own logging tables.

## Installing UC AI

### Option 1: GitHub release scripts

For each new release of UC AI the release page in GitHub will contain scripts to install the UC AI package and its dependencies.

- `install_uc_ai_complete.sql` installs all UC AI objects
- `install_uc_ai_complete_with_logger.sql` installs all UC AI objects and the Logger package
- `logger_no_op.sql` installs Logger in "no op" mode, meaning it will not log anything but the objects will compile. You can run `install_uc_ai_complete.sql` afterwards.
- `upgrade_packages.sql` upgrades the UC AI packages.Most of the time only packages get modified. So for most releases you just need to run this script to upgrade to a newer version. Please still keep an eye ont the [release notes](https://github.com/United-Codes/uc_ai/releases) to see if there are any changes that require you to run the complete installation script.

Just run the necessary script in your SQL client to install the UC AI package and its dependencies.

### Option 2: Install GitHub repository

Either download the source code of the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/United-Codes/uc_ai/releases/) or clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/United-Codes/uc_ai):

Run this script to install the UC AI with any SQL client:

```bash
# inside the uc_ai directory
sql ./install_uc_ai.sql
```

There is also a `install_with_logger.sql` script that installs the UC AI with the Logger package.

```bash
# inside the uc_ai directory
sql ./install_with_logger.sql
```

Alternatively if you don't want the logger installed you can install it's "no op" (no operation) version which installs the necessary objects so that the packages compile but does not log anything.

```bash
# inside the uc_ai directory
cd ./src/dependencies/logger_3.1.1
sql ./logger_install_no_op.sql
```

## Set up API Keys

The installation script created the following function. Modify it to return your API keys for the AI providers you want to use.

```sql
create or replace function uc_ai_get_key (
  p_provider in uc_ai.provider_type
)
  return varchar2
as
  e_unhandled_provider exception;
begin
  -- retrieve and return your keys from a secure location the way you prefer
  case p_provider
    when uc_ai.c_provider_openai then
      return 'change_me';
    when uc_ai.c_provider_anthropic then
      return '...';
    when uc_ai.c_provider_google then
      return '...';
    else
      raise e_unhandled_provider;
  end case;
exception
  when e_unhandled_provider then
    raise_application_error(-20001, 'No key defined for provider: ' || p_provider);
  when others then
    raise;
end uc_ai_get_key;
/
```

## Test if it is working

```sql
DECLARE
  l_result JSON_OBJECT_T;
BEGIN
  l_result := uc_ai.generate_text(
    p_user_prompt => 'What is APEX Office Print?',
    p_provider => uc_ai.c_provider_openai, -- change to your preferred provider
    p_model => uc_ai_openai.c_model_gpt_4o_mini -- change to your preferred model
  );

  -- Get the AI's response
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('AI Response: ' || l_result.get_string('final_message'));
END;
/
```

## Upgrades

Most of the time you just need to run the `upgrade_packages.sql` script to upgrade to a newer version of UC AI. This script will only upgrade the packages that have changed since the last version.

Please still keep an eye on the [release notes](https://github.com/United-Codes/uc_ai/releases) to see if there are any changes that require you to run the complete installation script.
